# Placeholder for Neural Signal Processing Screenshot
# This file should be replaced with an actual screenshot showing
# EEG signal processing, spectral analysis, and feature extraction.

# To create this screenshot:
# 1. Use mock EEG data or real OpenBCI device
# 2. Capture signal processing pipeline output
# 3. Show before/after artifact removal
# 4. Display feature extraction results
# 5. Save as eeg_signals.png in this directory
