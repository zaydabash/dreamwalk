### Installation

#### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zaydabash/dreamwalk.git
cd dreamwalk
./setup.sh
./run_demo.sh
```

#### Manual Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/zaydabash/dreamwalk.git
cd dreamwalk

# Copy environment file
cp env.example .env

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Run demo
python scripts/mock_eeg_stream.py
```

### Known Issues

#### Current Limitations
- **Real EEG Hardware**: Requires manual integration with OpenBCI or similar devices
- **Unity Setup**: Requires manual asset import and VR configuration
