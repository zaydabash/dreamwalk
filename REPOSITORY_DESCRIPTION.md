# DreamWalk Repository Description

## Short Description (for GitHub About section)
```
Advanced neural interface system that uses machine learning to decode brain signals and generate immersive virtual worlds. Combines EEG/fMRI processing, deep learning models, and real-time procedural generation to transform neural activity into explorable dreamscapes.
```

## Extended Description
```
DreamWalk is a cutting-edge neural interface platform that bridges neuroscience and artificial intelligence to create immersive virtual experiences. The system uses advanced machine learning algorithms to decode real-time EEG and fMRI signals, translating brain activity patterns into dynamic, procedurally generated virtual worlds.

Built on state-of-the-art neuroscience research and deep learning models, DreamWalk features:
• Real-time neural signal processing with ICA artifact removal
• EEG-to-CLIP embedding mapping using transformer architectures  
• Emotion classification via valence-arousal-dominance models
• Procedural world generation with Stable Diffusion integration
• Unity VR integration for immersive neural exploration

The platform enables researchers, therapists, and creators to visualize and interact with brain activity as living, breathing virtual environments. Applications span neuroscience research, therapeutic interventions, creative expression, and educational visualization of neural processes.
